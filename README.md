# Geo-Fencing

### Initial Requirements:
- All materials must be obtained through normal open source means (ie. the internet or a commercial outlet)
- The end product must be durable enough to withstand use on a person or in a pocket. (bumps, jostling, etc.)
- The item will more than likely be destroyed during the conduct of training (so it doesnâ€™t need to pretty it just needs to work)
- Powered by 9-12VDC
- Designed to react to a programmable/ alterable geographical boundary (ie. geo-fencing)
- Control unit would ideally be made with an Ardunio or comparable microcontroller.
- Designed to close a circuit/ contact when the item is outside of the geographical boundary and open the circuit when it is within the bounds.
- Reaction time of the item should be approximately 3-5 seconds.
- Item should be sensitive to the boundary within the space of 1-2 feet. With the margin of error making a larger space rather than a smaller one.
- Item can be controlled in any way that is reasonable for such an item. Wireless, Bluetooth, cellphone, GPS are all acceptable.
